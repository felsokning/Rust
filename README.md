# Rust
Programs written in Rust to accomplish varying tasks.

## first.rs
First Rust program, which returns a statement (in Swedish) via printing a line. (Not very impressive, I'm more than aware...)

## datetimeext
[Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) and [Implementation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/impl.html) of an extension to the DateTime<chrono::utc> object in Rust to print the ISO week number. (Compiles via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html).)
